                    hazardous gases</h2>
                <p>Sensors in the device, including the MQ135, MQ5, and MQ07, measure the concentration of various gases
                    in the air, such as those released during waste decomposition. These gases include ammonia, alcohol,
                    benzene, smoke, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, LPG, natural gas, coal gas, etc.</p>
